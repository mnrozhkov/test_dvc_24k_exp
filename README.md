This script takes two arguments: the number of loops and the number of experiments to run in parallel. It then creates temporary directories for each experiment, runs the DVC experiment inside each directory in parallel, and removes the temporary directories after each loop.

To use the script, save it to a file (e.g., run_dvc_experiments.sh), make it executable (chmod +x run_dvc_experiments.sh), and then run it with the desired number of loops and experiments as arguments:

bash
Copy code
./run_dvc_experiments.sh <number of loops> <number of experiments>
